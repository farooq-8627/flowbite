# entities Module (Core)

> All CRM entities: leads, contacts, deals, companies + 2 optional vertical
> slots (`entity5`, `entity6`). Shared scaffolds drive every entity through the
> same patterns — new entity = ~5 files, 1-2 days.

## The personCode invariant

Every person enters as a `Lead`. At that moment, `personCode` is generated
(`P-001`). It NEVER changes and travels to every related record:

```
Lead    → personCode "P-001" (generated here)
Contact → personCode "P-001" (inherited on conversion)
Deal    → personCode "P-001" (direct field)
Follow-up / file / message → personCode "P-001"
```

The unified profile page at `/profile/[personCode]` aggregates EVERY record
that belongs to that person — leads, contacts, deals, follow-ups, files,
messages — across the entity boundary.

## What the system can do today

| Capability | Mechanism | Read more |
|---|---|---|
| Add a field once → it appears everywhere | `fieldDefinitions` table + `useEntityFields` | `DYNAMIC_FIELDS_BLUEPRINT.md` |
| Reorder, hide, edit, delete fields | Drag-reorder list in Settings → Modules → \[Entity\] → Fields | `core/settings/components/groups/modules/SlotFieldsSection.tsx` |
| Per-user view toggles (table cols, card fields) | `ViewOptionsMenu` writes to `users.preferences` | `core/entities/shared/components/ViewOptionsMenu.tsx` |
| Rename "Lead" → "Inquiry" | `org.entityLabels`; `useEntityLabels()` reactive hook | `core/shared/hooks/useEntityLabels.ts` |
| Single-click instant convert | `LeadCard` event-stop wrapper + 240ms double-click guard | `_entities/leads/components/LeadCard.tsx` |
| First-time gesture coachmarks | `<FirstTimeTour>` with `data-tour` targeting | `components/ui/first-time-tour.tsx` |
| Dynamic kanban grouping | Switch `groupBy` between status / assignee / source / tag | `_entities/leads/views/LeadsView.tsx` |
| Card highlight slot for "important" custom fields | `EntityCard.highlightFieldDefs` filtered by cardFields | `core/entities/shared/components/EntityCard.tsx` |
| AI summary on cards | `item.aiSummary` rendered in middle row when present | (generator pending) |
| Universal file storage | `core/files/components/FileUpload`, scope-aware | `core/files/` |
| Industry presets seed fields on org creation | `convex/orgs/templates/fields.ts` + `ensureForOrg` mutation | `convex/crm/fields/fieldDefinitions/internal.ts` |

## Conversion flows

```
Lead ─[convert]→ Contact (personCode preserved)
                   │
                   └─[also create deal? optional]─→ Deal (linked back to contact + personCode)
```

- Single-click on the card's `+` shortcut = instant convert (no form).
- Double-click = open the convert drawer (with the "Also create a deal?"
  toggle).
- Bulk select rows → "Convert N" toolbar button (single drawer, all at once).

```
Contact ─[revertToLead]→ Lead (back to status="new")
```

## What's marketing-worthy

See `DYNAMIC_FIELDS_BLUEPRINT.md` §7 for the full pitch list. Highlights:

- "Pick your industry. We do the rest."
- "One field. Every screen."
- "Click to convert. Double-click for options."
- "Drag to change status."
- "Your view, your rules."
- "We teach the gesture. Once."

## Pending — see `STATE.md` §Pending

- Stage filter UI on tables.
- Saved views per user.
- Files tab on entity detail views.
- AI summary generator (the slot exists; the writer is missing).
- "Replay tutorials" button in Appearance settings.


## 2026-05-17 — Per-user persisted column order

| # | Decision | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | LeadsView / ContactDetailView (the contacts list view) / CompaniesView all wire `usePersistedColumnOrder(slot, boardColumns)` and pass the resulting `onColumnReorder` to `EntityListPage`. | Column drag now sticks across reloads. Slot keys include the active `groupBy` so swapping groupings doesn't carry stale orderings (`lead:status` vs `lead:assignedTo` vs `lead:tag`). |
| 2 | Deals board is intentionally NOT wired in this pass. | Pipeline stages are an org-wide doc gated on `pipelines.manage`. The follow-up adds a server reorder call, an early-return when the user lacks the perm, and an optimistic local update. Tracked in `core/entities/_entities/deals/MODULE.md`. |


## 2026-05-17 — EntityCard drag smoothness

| # | Decision | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | EntityCard now uses `transition-shadow` (not `transition-all`) and drops `opacity-60` while dragging. | Aligns the drag-overlay clone with the notes board's smoother feel. Tailwind's `transition-all` was animating the dnd-kit transform, fighting the primitive's own transition string and looking janky. The card-flash border animation is a `@keyframes` so it still works without `transition-all`. The hover affordances now only apply when not dragging. |


## 2026-05-21 — Tables unified through `useEntityColumns`; deals tables become stage-aware

| # | Decision | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Contacts, Companies, Deals tables all flow through `useEntityColumns` (same path leads has used since the dispatcher landed). The hand-rolled `useMemo<ColumnDef>` blocks in those views are gone, and `core/entities/_entities/deals/hooks/useDealsListColumns.tsx` is deleted. | One column factory drives every table. Sortable headers (via `<DataTableColumnHeader>`), batched tags via `tagsByEntityId`, batched companies via `companiesByPersonCode`, dispatcher-rendered cells (proper labels, currency from org settings, `+` inline-edit button on every empty cell) — all consistent across entities. The kanban side is untouched; only the list path changed. |
| 2 | Tables remain "render every visible field" for leads, contacts, companies. For deals, when the toolbar `StageFilter` is set, the table narrows to *Default-stage pinned* fields (the admin-curated always-on set: dealCode, title, value, assignee, etc.) PLUS the *active stage's* pinned fields. No filter → every visible field, same as before. The `deals.viewValues` permission still gates the `value` column on top of stage logic. | Admin-driven, no hardcoded "default" lists. The pipeline's Default stage (stage with `isDefaultStage: true`) is the SSOT for "always-on" deal fields, matching locked rule 11. The narrowing is implemented in `DealsView` by computing `hiddenColumnIds: Set<string>` and forwarding it to `useEntityColumns` — the factory itself stays renderer-agnostic. The doc-comment in `useEntityFields.ts` was updated to make this contract explicit (tables for stage-aware entities can be narrowed at the view layer; the hook does not pre-filter `tableFields` by `showInStages`). |
| 3 | Removed direct `<AssigneeCell>`, `<CompanyCell>`, `<TagsCell>`, `<PersonCodeBadge>`, `<DataTableRowActions>`, `<Checkbox>` imports from ContactsView and CompaniesView (and the AssigneeCell/Badge imports from the deleted dealsListColumns). The components stay — they're rendered by the cell-dispatcher. | Eliminates the contacts table's per-row `getByPersonCode` storm (every row had its own subscription, and any mutation invalidated the lot — the "company keeps refetching for every operation" symptom). Eliminates the companies table's missing tags column (no `tags` case existed in the hand-rolled switch). Cards and tables now read tags from the same `useEntityTagsMap` batch — no more "out of sync with cards". |
